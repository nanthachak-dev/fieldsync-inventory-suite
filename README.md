# FieldSync Inventory Suite
### *A Full-Stack Data Synchronization & Resource Management Framework*

---

## 📋 Project Overview
**FieldSync** is a technical demonstration of an "offline-first" architecture designed to manage resource flows between remote field locations and a centralized administrative hub. 

It is engineered to support high-reliability data synchronization, secure API communication, and real-time inventory monitoring—specifically tailored for environments where network stability may be inconsistent.

## ✨ Key Functionalities
* **Offline-First Architecture**: Ensures field data is captured locally and synchronized automatically when a connection is restored.
* **Secure API Gateway**: Provides a robust interoperability layer for seamless communication between mobile clients and the central database.
* **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enables administrative oversight of inventory levels and resource distribution across multiple geographic nodes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java) + RESTful API
* **Mobile**: Kotlin (Jetpack Compose)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Infrastructure**: Docker
